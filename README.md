# DriveSmart

Driving is often a necessity depending on factors such as location, lifestyle, etc. However, it can lead to long-lasting effects if not done correctly. Learning to drive requires the help of an experienced driver or from a professional driving instructor. However, driving instruction lacks a way to review your performance after a lesson. This hinders the development of safe driving habits as it does not provide new learners with clear feedback on their progress or areas for improvement. The proposed solution aims to solve these problems with a mobile application. The application would record various driving metrics using the built-in sensors during a lesson and upload that information to the cloud. Students will be able to review this information to get a better idea of where they need improvement, and suggestions will be provided to learn how they can improve.
